### Introduction
Domain-Driven Design is an approach to software development that emphasizes a deep understanding of the business domain and uses a strategic and tactical design to create a flexible and maintainable software system. The fc-ddd-patterns project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for DDD by presenting various scenarios and practical implementations of DDD patterns.

The project covers essential concepts such as bounded contexts, aggregates, entities, value objects, repositories, domain events, and more. By exploring these concepts through code examples, developers can gain a solid understanding of how to structure their applications using DDD principles.

### Installation
To get started with fc-ddd-patterns, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/blarth/fc-ddd-patterns.git
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd fc-ddd-patterns
npm install
### Usage
The project provides a collection of code examples and implementations of DDD patterns. Each example is self-contained and can be run independently. To explore a specific DDD pattern or concept, navigate to the corresponding directory and examine the code.

You can also modify the code and experiment with different scenarios to deepen your understanding of DDD. The project encourages hands-on learning and provides a playground for developers to practice DDD techniques.

### Examples
The fc-ddd-patterns project offers a variety of examples that cover different aspects of DDD. Here are some key examples:

order-management/: Demonstrates how to model an order management system using DDD patterns, including aggregates, repositories, and domain events.

customer-management/: Shows how to apply DDD patterns to build an customer management system, including bounded contexts, value objects, aggregates, and event sourcing, domain events.

These examples serve as starting points for understanding and practicing DDD. Feel free to explore them and modify the code to suit your learning needs.
